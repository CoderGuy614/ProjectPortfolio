          <p>
            As a kid growing up in Columbus Ohio, I seemed to always be taking things apart, tinkering with them, and sometimes even putting them back together.  Starting out with model rockets and trains as a youth, classic cars as a teenager, and eventually progressing to advanced engines and gas turbines as an adult. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015, having never traveled outside of the United States, I wanted to learn about some other cultures around the world.  So, I set off with a single backpack and a one-way ticket to Thailand.  Since that time, I have filled up a couple of passports, become an experienced scuba diver, and had the pleasure of being able to share my passion for science and technology with hundreds of children in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and China.
          </p>
          <p>In 2019, after not writing any code since college, I took up learning JavaScript as a hobby.  I enjoyed it so much I decided to pursue it as a full time career. Enough talk, I need to go code now. Happy hacking!</p>
